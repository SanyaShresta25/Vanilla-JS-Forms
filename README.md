# 🎓 Student Discount Form

This is a fun and interactive JavaScript-based form project that checks if you're eligible for a student discount based on your age and student status. It's a part of my ongoing JavaScript practice series, with more features to be added in the future.

## 🧠 What I Learned

I learned how to:
- Use `addEventListener` and `onsubmit` to capture and handle form events.
- Utilize `switch(true)` for range-based conditional logic.
- Display dynamic HTML content using `innerHTML`.
- Organize layouts using CSS Grid and make the form look visually engaging.
- Think in terms of reusable components and build logic progressively.
